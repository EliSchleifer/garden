# Contributing to the Docs

Our docs are divided into sections. You can make a section by creating a folder and adding a `README.md` file with the contents

```markdown
---
order: 2
title: Tutorials
---
```

If you create a new page, make sure it belongs to a folder inside `docs/` and that it has frontmatter, just like when creating a section. This determines the order of the file inside the section.
