This tutorial walks you through the first few steps of getting started with Garden using one of the Kubernetes plugins (
local or remote).

We'll go through:

1. [Initializing a simple example project](./1-initialize-a-project.md)
2. [Connecting to a Kubernetes cluster](./2-connect-to-a-cluster.md)
3. [Deploying and testing the project](./3-deploy-and-test.md)
4. How you can go from there and [configure your own project](./4-configure-your-project.md)

You'll need to have Garden installed to follow along with this guide. You'll find the instructions in
our [Quickstart guide](../../getting-started/quickstart.md).

We also recommend quickly reading the [How Garden Works](../../overview/how-garden-works.md) page before carrying on.

Once you've done that, head on over to the [next page](./1-initialize-a-project.md)!
