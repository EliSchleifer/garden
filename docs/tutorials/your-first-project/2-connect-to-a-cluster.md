# 2. Connect to a Cluster

In order to deploy your new project, you (perhaps obviously) need somewhere to deploy it to.

Here we hit a bit of a fork in the road, since you have a choice between using our ephemeral clusters, setting up a local Kubernetes cluster on your dev machine _or_ to connect to a remote cluster.

If you are here for the first time or just trying out Garden, we recommend you to get started with ephemeral Garden Kubernetes, since it requires no additional setup on your end.

We have separate guides for each of these options. Pick the one you prefer, walk through that guide, and then come back here or skip straight to the [next section](./3-deploy-and-test.md).

* [Ephemeral Garden Kubernetes](../../k8s-plugins/ephemeral-k8s/README.md)
* [Local Kubernetes](../../k8s-plugins/local-k8s/README.md)
* [Remote Kubernetes](../../k8s-plugins/remote-k8s/README.md)

Once you've set up your cluster and updated your project configuration accordingly, we can move on to [deploying and testing your project](./3-deploy-and-test.md).
